        <p style="line-height: 1.5">Bring your friends and family and book a tour with Johnny. Johnny is the perfect
            guide. Not only does he love
            cycling, he has also lived in Nelson for many years and knows all the secrets Nelson has to offer. We know
            that a good cycle fit can make or break your tour, so each bike is fitted to each cyclist's unique size.
            Your bike comes with a comfortable saddle, a rear rack and a lockable compartment. Johnny offers two routes
            on his tours, one that goes outside of the city to Golden Bay with stunning views of the coastline. This for
            experienced riders and takes a full day.<br>
            <br>For the less hardy, he offers a short, easy bike around around Nelson's arty boutique shops and cafes,
            to the Nelson Cathedral and to the wearable Arts Museum. This takes one to two hours.
