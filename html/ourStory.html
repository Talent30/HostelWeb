    <h1>Our story in Nelson Mail</h1>
    <p><br>In what is believed to be a first for New Zealand accommodation Nelson Hostel is tempting visitors with an array
        of free food.
        <br>Hot chocolate pudding is being offered to all guests at 8 pm each night. The move has proved very popular, with
        a 50% increase in bookings for the two weeks the chocolate has been on offer. Not only is hot chocolate
        available, freshly baked bread is provided with breakfast each morning. Manager Johnny said “we often see
        backpackers arriving cold and tired after either a long trip or a busy day and we thought there is nothing nicer
        than hot chocolate or the smell of freshly baked bread.” Mr Johnny said it is no trouble to bake the bread each
        morning and it is providing a real hit with guests. “Word has got around about this service and we have been
        inundated with enquiries.”<br>
        <br>Nelson Hostel is in the centre if the thriving city of Nelson famous for its Wearable Arts Museum and artistic
        town centre. Nelson, a beachside destination at the top of the South Island is the gateway to the famed West
        Coast of the South Island. Visitors can also join Johnny for a bike tour of Nelson. The bikes do not have to be
        booked in advance as the hostel has them for on-the-spot hirage.<br>
        <br>Beautiful days, clear night and picturesque beaches are some of the attractions of staying in Nelson says Mr
        Johnny, Couple that with the delicious free hot chocolate and fresh homemade bread and there is nothing else
        like this available in a hostel in the Southern Hemisphere.
